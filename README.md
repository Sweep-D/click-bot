# Twitch Bonus claim bot

Will add a requirements.txt file later. 
Using selenium to automatically login to a twitch account. Open up a channel and then try to click the claim bonus if it exists.

# Notes:
Honestly the hardest thing about this was trying to understand the authentication for google gmail api, then finding the right email with the security code and parsing it.

# Upcoming changes:
- Check if the channel is live or not.
- Add multiple channels at once. 
- Make it self running
- Try to avoid more captcha?
